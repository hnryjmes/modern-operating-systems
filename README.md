ICs, Integrated Circuits, OS/360, multiprogramming, spooling, Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On Line, timesharing, CTSS, Compatible Time Sharing System

"We will use the terms “procedure,” “subroutine,” and “function” interchangeably in this book."

MULTICS, MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service, cloud computing

"Despite its lack of commercial success, MULTICS had a huge influence on subsequent operating systems (especially UNIX and its derivatives, FreeBSD, Linux, iOS, and Android)."

UNIX, System V, BSD, Berkeley Software Distribution, POSIX, MINIX, Linux

##### 1.2.4 The Fourth Generation (1980-Present): Personal Computers

##### 1.2.5 The Fifth Generation (1990-Present): Mobile Computers

PDA, Symbian, RIM, iPhone

#### 1.3 COMPUTER HARDWARE REVIEW

##### 1.3.1 Processors

program counter, stack pointer, PSW, Program Status Word, pipeline, superscalar

"Generally, all instructions involving I/O and memory protection are disallowed in user mode."

system call, multithreading, hyperthreading, GPU, Graphics Processing Unit

##### 1.3.2 Memory

cache lines, cache hit, L1 cache, L2 cache, RAM, Random Access Memory, core memory, ROM, Read Only Memory, EEPROM, Electrically Erasable PROM, flash memory

##### 1.3.3 Disks

track, cylinder, SSDs, Solid State Disks, virtual memory, MMU, Memory Management Unit, context switch

##### 1.3.4 I/O Devices

SATA, Serial ATA, ATA, AT Attachment

"In case you are curious what AT stands for, this was IBM's second generation “Personal Computer Advanced Technology” built around the then-extremely-potent 6-MHz 80286 processor that the company introduced in 1984."

device driver, I/O port space, busy waiting, interrupt, interrupt vector, DMA, Direct Memory Access

##### 1.3.5 Buses

PCIe, Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, PCI, ISA, Industry Standard Architecture, shared bus architecture, parallel bus architecture, serial bus architecture, DMI, Direct Media Interface, USB, Universal Serial Bus, SCSI, Small Computer System Interface, plug and play

##### 1.3.6 Booting the Computer

BIOS, Basic Input Output System

#### 1.4 THE OPERATING SYSTEM ZOO

##### 1.4.1 Mainframe Operating System

##### 1.4.2 Server Operating Systems

##### 1.4.3 Multiprocessor Operating Systems

##### 1.4.4 Personal Computer Operating Systems

"Common examples are Linux, FreeBSD, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Apple's OS X."

##### 1.4.5 Handheld Computer Operating Systems

PDA, Personal Digital Assistant, apps

##### 1.4.6 Embedded Operating Systems

"Typical examples are microwave ovens, TV sets, cars, DVD recorders, traditional phones, and MP3 players."

##### 1.4.7 Sensor-Node Operating Systems

##### 1.4.8 Real-Time Operating Systems

hard real-time system

"Many of these are found in industrial process control, avionics, military, and similar application areas."

soft real-time system

"Smartphones are also soft real-time systems."

##### 1.4.9 Smart Card Operating Systems

#### 1.5 OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS

##### 1.5.1 Processes

process, address space, process table, core image, command interpreter, child processes, interprocess communication, alarm signal

"Signals are the software analog of hardware interrupts and can be generated by a variety of causes in addition to timers expiring."

UID, User IDentification, GID, Group IDentification, superuser, Administrator

##### 1.5.2 Address Spaces

"The address space is decoupled from the machine's physical memory and may be either larger or smaller than the physical memory."

##### 1.5.3 Files

directory, path name, root directory, working directory, file descriptor, root file system, special file, block special files, character special files, pipes

"Thus, communication between processes in UNIX looks very much like ordinary file reads and writes."

##### 1.5.4 Input/Output

##### 1.5.5 Protection

"Files in UNIX are protected by assigning each one a 9-bit binary protection code."

rwx bits, read, write, execute

##### 1.5.6 The Shell

"Although it is not part of the operating system, it makes heavy use of many operating system features and thus serves as a good example of how the system calls are used."

"Many shells exist, including sh, csh, ksh, and bash."

prompt

"If a user puts an ampersand after a command, the shell does not wait for it to complete."

##### 1.5.7 Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny

"Each new species (mainframe, minicomputer, personal computer, handheld, embedded computer, smart card, etc.) seems to go through the development that its ancestors did, both in hardware and in software."

Large Memories, Protection Hardware, Disks, Virtual Memory

#### 1.6 SYSTEM CALLS

"We have seen that operating systems have two main functions: providing abstractions to user programs and managing the computer's resources."

##### 1.6.1 System Calls for Process Management

PID, Process IDentifier, text segment, data segment, stack segment

##### 1.6.2 System Calls for File Management

##### 1.6.3 System Calls for Directory Management

i-nodes, partitions, minor devices

##### 1.6.4 Miscellaneous System Calls

"The chmod system call makes it possible to change the mode of a file."

"Windows and UNIX differ in a fundamental way in their respective programming models."

Win32 API, Application Programming Interface

"The number of Win32 API calls is extremely large, numbering in the thousands."

#### 1.7 OPERATING SYSTEM STRUCTURE
